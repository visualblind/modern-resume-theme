          Quad0.com was created as a project to test WordPress, initially. It has evolved through hacking attempts, environment migrations, hardware failures, and is continuing to transform into a small but valuable repository of technical articles, systems-related documentation along with downloadable scripts. The goal is to provide you with info worthy of taking up a bookmark if you are a Sysadmin working on the x86_64 platform.
